## Sample Requirements

We welcome sample submissions.

However, because the sample galleries are powered by the github sample repos, each sample needs to have the following things:

* **Screenshots** - a folder called Screenshots that has at least one screen shot of the sample (preferably a screen shot for every page or every major functionality piece, people really key off these things).

* **Readme** - a[ README.md](http://readme.md/) file that has the name of the sample, a description, and author attribution.

* **Metadata** - Finally, it needs a Metadata.xml file ([https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples/blob/master/Tasky/Metadata.xml](https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples/blob/master/Tasky/Metadata.xml)) that has some information:

    * **ID** - A GUID for the sample. You can generate this in MD under Tools menu : Insert GUID. we need this to key between articles and their associated samples

    * **Brief** - Short description or what your sample does. This allows us to display a nice and clean vignette on the sample page.

    * **Tags**: a list of relevant tags for the app. 

    * **Gallery**: This tag must contain a value of true if you want the sample to show up in the samples gallery on the developer portal.

* **Buildable Sln and CSProj file** - the project _must_ build and have the appropriate project scaffolding (solution + proj).
