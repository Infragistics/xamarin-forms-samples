## Moo2U
Moo2U is an end-to-end, best practices reference application built on top of Xamarin.Forms, using the innovative Productivity Pack and UI widgets from Infragistics. Designed using an iterative UX process, Moo2U not only demonstrates how a Xamarin.Forms mobile app should be built to scale, but how interactions and styling should be applied. Moo2U covers the scenario of a mobile delivery service transporting goods from an organic farming business to stores. It incorporates controls like charts, gauges, and maps to allow the driver to enter and orders, get turn-by turn-directions, and view order and delivery statistics.
